The Goal: Similar to the first project, this project also uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user and reads a list with that index to pick between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The user is then prompted to also pick between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The two choices are then compared for a winner. Rock beats scissors, Scissors beats paper, Paper beats rock. The results are presented.

Concepts to keep in mind:

Random function
Variables
Integers
Input/Output
Print
While loops
If/Else statements


Jumping off the first project, this project continues to build up the base knowledge and introduces user-inputted data at its very simplest. With user input, we start to get into a little bit of variability.
